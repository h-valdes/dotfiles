# dotfiles


Dotfiles for a fresh install of Manjaro i3 (Community Edition). It has 2 
scripts, one for a completly fresh install (fresh-build.sh) and one to update
the dotfiles.

The fresh-build.sh script install the following programs:
* rofi

* okular

The fresh install script install VSCode and other programas that I use for 
development.
